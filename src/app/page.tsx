      <h2 className="mb-4 text-xl font-bold">Technology Overview</h2>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Legged robots have just reached a maturity level where real-world deployment is not only feasible but transformative.
        We leverage both quadruped and humanoid robots for security patrolling, offering much more capable solution over existing wheeled security robots at a fraction of the cost.
        We've developed robust controllers that allow these robots to easily navigate diverse terrains like mud and stairs,
        while also integrating our unified AI and software platform to enable the capabilities of a security guard.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        Thanks for unprecedented energy and effort in robotics research and development currently, we're advancing towards world foundational models that would endow robots with both cognitive and motor skills akin to humans.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-8">
        At RoboGuard, we are the first to deploy these advanced robots to handle dangerous and boring tasks, thereby not only enhancing safety & security but also creating substantial economic value.
